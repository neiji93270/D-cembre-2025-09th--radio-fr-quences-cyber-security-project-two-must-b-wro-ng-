//we can negate ciphers if there are close signals enough close to rpobes.. Then, a sparse databse cannot handle that.
//we would better to keep track of non related all bytes dtas to convert them into ciphers if the thoeries of theories we take could
//track differential evolutions. This is also a virtualizer of databses if the next theory is close to other theories related to sparse models.
